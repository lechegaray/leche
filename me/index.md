Hello, my name is Luis Echegaray. I specialize in eating pizza and watching anime. I like arguing about CSS frameworks with my partner @melvinopolis.  I own some bakeries.  

# What do you do?
I am head of operations and continuous delivery at Kingsmen Software.

# What programming languages do you use?
I like this basic question. I used to do full stack JavaScript back in the good (bad) days of jquery EVERYTHING.  Nowadays, my front end framework of choice in React.  In reality tho, I spend all my time building continuous delivery pipeline in the cloud.  I hop from java/groovy, c#,  node, and go. I also do a lot of hashicorp stuff, which helps me jam shell/powershell scripts everywhere.  I love helping teams of developers move fast and closing that feedback loop.
