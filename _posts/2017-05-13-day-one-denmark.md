title: Day 1: Denmark and "Sandwiches"
---

**TL;DR** The greatest of plans of catching up with Dockercon videos, Copenhagen land of bikes and sandwiches, and cool AirBnB

# Preflight Fun
YouTube Red is primed with 150 conference videos to watch (Dockercon 2017 and GOTO Chicago 2016).  I feel like that is not enough. Reality: I watch the Docker keynote and fall asleep. They feed me twice.

# Land of bikes
Lots of bikes in Copenhagen and they have NO FEAR.

# First eatery
PUT NAME HERE, we have traditional sandwiches which are open faced and have chasers.  Strange. Good coffee

# Write blog posts
Forcing myself to use only VIM and writing instead of taking power naps, I want to be in a profound sleep tonight to shake off any time lag.
