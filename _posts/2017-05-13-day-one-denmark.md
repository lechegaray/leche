title: Day 1 - Copenhagen, Denmark
---

**TL;DR** The greatest of plans of catching up with Dockercon videos, Copenhagen land of bikes and sandwiches, and cool AirBnB

# Preflight Fun
Loaded up YouTube Red with 150 conference videos to watch (Dockercon 2017 and GOTO Chicago 2016).  Did not feel like it was enough. Reality: I watched the Docker keynote and fell asleep. 

# Lunch
Restaurant Schonnemann (http://www.restaurantschonnemann.dk), we had traditional sandwiches which are open faced and each have accompanying chasers. I am not convinced about their definition of a sandwich. Great coffee.

# Evening Dinner
Pony (http://www.ponykbh.dk), 3 course dinner but the highlight was their fresh bread with butter cream. Lord.

# Tech
Working Copy (https://workingcopyapp.com) has been great but was unable to pull down one more my larger projects.  The repo fails to download, crashes the app, and then never lets the app start again.  Had to remove and reinstall the app completely.

Other than my larger projects, it has been fantastic for editing the occasional Jenkinsfile or Dockerfile.
