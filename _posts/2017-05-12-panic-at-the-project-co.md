title: Upcoming trip and panic 
---

**TL;DR** Heading off for a two week vacation, while multiple projects are launching!  Leads to experimental iPad development tools and keyboard attachments.

# Vacation
The problem with loving your work is that you just let those vacation days pass you by and you lose like half of them, and then your girlfriend finds out and screams at you. I generally take working vacations to Florida but nothing that seriously disconnects me from my projects and infrastructure.  Then comes a 2 week trip to NY -> Denmark -> Israel, and everything seems fine.  Then a project starts later than expected and another starts earlier than anticipated.  They are all starting at the same time.  You have little time to train the people to cover you and BAM! You start looking for ways to stay connected Just In Case.

# Technology scramble
So a disconnected vacation is no longer possible! Keep it simple, lug your 15inch MacBook Pro (was gonna do that anyway) and carve out some time with you people. Bad news: laptop bans from Europe -> USA announced.  Crap.

Ok, how about an ssh client on you iPad to do some badass ops work and VIM it up? Fantastic. A good editor to do some local work ala a BLOG. Awesome.  A wifi hotspot that spans the three countries? Cool.

Then you realize, your dudes are competent, nothing will fall apart and you spent a lot of time looking up and testing tools instead of training your peeps in one more thing.

# Write blog posts
But that would be boring! You assembled the avengers of iPad tools and you will USE THEM. OK BLOG TIME!
